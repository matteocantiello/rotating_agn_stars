# MESA: Stellar Evolution in AGN Disks, including Rotation
MESA extension for modeling stellar evolution in AGN disks. Implements self-consistent accretion of mass and angular momentum from the disk environment, including rotational mixing and spin evolution. Based on the AGN star framework (Cantiello et al. 2021) with modifications by Alex Dittmann and Eb Farag, ported to MESA r24.08.1. Angular momentum accretion follows Jermyn et al. (2021).
